# Bruno Emacs Library

This is a personal Emacs library for various Emacs automation. Includes utilities that
do things such as search notes, define shortcuts and automatically create constructs within notes.

# Notes

- The path to binary files that are executed is currently hard coded. Need to fix that and move all emacs related things into ~/.emacs.d
